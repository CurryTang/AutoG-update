        Imagine you are an expert graph data scientist, and now you are expected to construct graph schema based on the original
        inputs. You will be given an original schema represented in the dictionary format:
        <data>
            1. dataset_name: name of the dataset 
            2. tables: meta data for list of tables, each one will present following attributes
                1. name: table name
                2. source: source of the data, can either be a numpy .npz file or a parquet file
                3. columns: list of columns, each column will have following attributes
                    1. name: column name
                    2. dtype: column type, can be either text, categorical, float, primary_key, foreign_key, or multi_category.
                    primary_key and foreign_key are two special types of categorical columns, which presents a structural
                    relationship with other tables. Multi_category means this column is of list type, and each cell main contains
                    a list of categorical values. After a column is set as primary_key or foreign_key, it should not be changed to other types.
                    3. link_to (optional): if this column is a foreign key, point to which primary key from which table
            3. statistics of the table: statistics of the column value of tables. These statistics can be used to help you
            determine the characteristics of the columns. For example, if one categorical column only contains one unique value,
            then creating a node type based on this column can result in a super node, which is not ideal for graph construction.
            You should also determine whether two columns represent the same thing based on these statistics. 
            4. Dummy table is a special type of table. It's not explicitly defined with a table slot. It's defined in other tables, such as
            {"name": "nation", "dtype": "foreign_key", "link_to": "Country.CountryID"}. In this case, "Country" is a dummy table, which is not 
            explicitly defined in the tables slot.
        </data>                
        Here are the documents of the actions:
        
        Here is the introduction of the function generate_or_connect_dummy_table:
Description:
This function can be used in two ways:
1. Generate a dummy table with only one primary key
2. Turn an existing column with categorical type to an existing dummy table
"orig_col_name" must be a column with category type
Parameters:
dbb: the database object
base_table_name: the name of the original table
orig_col_name: the name of the original column in the original table, this should be a column with category type
new_table_name: the name of the new table to be created/connected
new_col_name: the name of the new column to be created/connected

Here is the introduction of the function connect_two_columns:
Description:
Connect two columns, this function can be used for the following case. Always put the column with category type in table 1.
1. A category column in table 1 is connected to a category column in table 2, in this case, a new dummy table will be created
2. A category column in table 1 is connected to a primary key column in table 2, in this case, the column in table 1 will be turned into a foreign key column. In case 2, table_2_col_name must be a primary key column
3. A category column in table 1 is connected to a non-category and non-primary key column in table 2, in this case, we will use a trick called Surrogate Key. 
4. If the column in table 1 is already a foreign key, then in this case it's probably a multi-column-point-to-one case, we need to update other fk columns too.
Parameters:
dbb: the database object
table_1_name: the name of the first table, 
table_1_col_name: the name of the column in the first table, this should be a column with category type
table_2_name: the name of the second table
table_2_col_name: the name of the column in the second table, this should be a column with category type

Here is the introduction of the function explode_multi_category_column:
Description:
Explode a multi-category column into multiple columns. You should determine whether to use this function. If you don't explode a multi-category column, it will be treated as a single category column automatically.
Parameters:
dbb: the database object
original_table: name of the original table where the multi-category column is located
multi_cat_col: the name of the multi-category column
primary_key_column: the name of the primary key column in the original table
new_table_name: the name of the new table to be created
new_col_name: the name of the new column to be created
dtype: the data type of the new column, if set to "foreign_key", this table will contain only "foreign_keys". In this case, it means you only want to use this column's relaion. If set to other types, this table will contain the original column's values, and a primary key will be added, this means you want to use this column's values.

Here is the introduction of the function generate_non_dummy_table:
Description:
Generate a non-dummy table with columns in the original table
Parameters:
dbb: the database object
base_table_name: the name of the original table
cols: the list of columns to be included in the new table and removed from the original table
new_table_name: the name of the new table to be created

Here is the introduction of the function remove_primary_key:
Description:
Remove a primary key constraint from a column in the original table
If the column is just an index, then the column will be removed from the table.
For example, if the schema is like {
    {"name": "id", "dtype": "primary_key"},
    {"name": "user", "dtype": "foreign_key", "link_to": "user.userID"},
    {"name": "book", "dtype": "foreign_key", "link_to": "book.bookID"},
}
In such case, it's clear that this table represents the role of an edge, while the presence of primary key prevents heuristic to turn this table into an edge. Primary key is not needed in this case.
In such case, we will remove the primary key constraint from the column.
Parameters:
dbb: the database object
base_table_name: the name of the original table
col_name: the name of the column in the original table

Here is the introduction of the function add_primary_key:
Description:
Add a primary key column to the original table
Parameters:
dbb: the database object
base_table_name: the name of the original table
col_name: the name of the newly added primary key column

        
        Now, you need to 
        1. Actively think about whether any one of the four actions should be conducted; If not, you can select "None" and then halt the program.
        2. output all actions you can think of from the above list to perform, and output your selection in the following format. It should be noted that for those actions with sequential relation like one new categorical column generated after expanding a multi-category column, you don't need to generate in one round.
        
        <selection>
        [{'explanation': <explanation for the selection>, 'action': <first action>, 'parameters': <parameters for the first action> },
        {'explanation': <explanation for the selection>, 'action': <second action>, 'parameters': <parameters for the second action> }, ...
        ]
        </selection>

        
        3. If not more action, output <selection>None</selection>

Now I want to train a model which can predict the category of a paper based on the information in the paper.

Here we gives the similarity score of each column pair, you can use this information to determine whether two columns may be joinable. The similarity score is scaled to [0, 1], the larger means the more similar.
<similarity>
The pair with the 1st highest similarity is column "Journal" from Table "Paper" and column "Name" from Table "Journal" with similarity 0.885
The pair with the 2nd highest similarity is column "Authors" from Table "Paper" and column "Name" from Table "Journal" with similarity 0.743
The pair with the 3rd highest similarity is column "Authors" from Table "Paper" and column "Country" from Table "Journal" with similarity 0.723
</similarity>
</input>



We need to think about whether we need to do one of the six actions:
1. First, for explode_multi_category_column, the Authors of the paper are in a multi-category column. Moreover, author is closely related to the category of the paper, so the relationship Paper-Author-Paper can be very useful. So, we need to explode this multi category column.
2. For connect_two_columns, the Journal column in the Paper table and the  column Name in the Journal table are highly similar, so we can connect these two columns with a foreign key constraint. Other pairs like Authors and Name, Authors and Country are not similar enough to be connected.
3. For generate_non_dummy_table, the Publisher and PublisherLocation columns are independent columns for the entity Publisher. We can generate a new table Publisher with these two columns.
4. For generate_or_connect_dummy_table, we need to find those categorical columns beneficial for downstream task. We have categorical columns (Journal has been deleted in step 2, Category is the final objective) Keyword, Country, this will result in relationship Paper-Keyword-Paper and Paper-Journal-Country-Journal-Paper respectively. Since the target is to predict the category of a paper, we can generate a dummy table for the column Keyword since paper sharing the same keyword are highly likely to share the same category. Country may be not beneficial since it doesn't present a strong semantic relationship with the category. 
5. For remove_primary_key and add_primary_key, there's no unreasonable primary key or missing primary key in the table, so we don't need to do this action. as a result, we have the following actions
<selection>
        [{{'explanation': "Author is multi-category and Paper-Author-Paper is probably useful. We set the dtype to foreign_key because we want to use the relation", 'action': 'explode_multi_category_column', 'parameters': {'original_table': 'Paper', 'multi_cat_col': 'Author', primary_key_column: 'PaperID', 'new_table_name': 'Author', 'new_col_name': 'AuthorName', 'dtype': 'foreign_key'}},
